# Advent of Code 2022 Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code 2022 challenges. The purpose of this repository is to learn and practice programming in Rust.

## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an annual programming event that takes place in December. Each day, a new coding puzzle is released, and participants are encouraged to solve it using their programming skills. The challenges range from simple to complex and cover various programming concepts and algorithms.

## Why Rust?

I have chosen Rust as the programming language for solving the Advent of Code challenges because it offers a unique combination of performance, safety, and expressiveness. Rust's strict compile-time checks and memory safety features help me write reliable and efficient code. Additionally, Rust's modern syntax and powerful standard library make it an excellent choice for tackling algorithmic problems.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by days, with each day's challenge having its own directory. Inside each directory, you will find the Rust source code files for the corresponding challenge. The solutions are implemented in a modular and reusable manner, following best practices and idiomatic Rust coding style.

## Running the Solutions

To run the solutions, make sure you have Rust installed on your system. Then, navigate to the specific day's directory and use the following command:

```
cargo run
```

This command will compile and execute the Rust code, providing the output or result of the challenge. Additionally, each day's directory may contain input files or additional instructions necessary to solve the challenge.

## Contribution and Feedback

If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. I appreciate any feedback that can help me improve my coding skills in Rust.

## Disclaimer

Please note that the solutions provided in this repository are my own and may not be the most optimal or efficient solutions. They are primarily meant for learning and exploration purposes. If you are participating in Advent of Code, I encourage you to attempt the challenges yourself before consulting external solutions.

Happy coding and enjoy Advent of Code 2022!
